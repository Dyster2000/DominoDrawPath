# DominoDrawPath

The DominoDrawBluetooth directory is the Arduino code for the bluetooth path following robot. This requires an Arduino ESP32 nano chip.

The DominoPathDrawApp is a .net Maui app that is functional on an Android. Since it is Maui, it could be made to work on an iPhone as well. It just needs the iPhone specific bluetooth code added.
